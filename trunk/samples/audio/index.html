<h2>Audio Canvas</h2>
<p>This site introduces an early version of an audio engine with JavaScript bindings. This audio API is analogous to the &lt;canvas&gt; tag for 2D and 3D graphics.  The audio system proposed here is capable of dynamically positioning/spatializing and mixing multiple sound sources in three-dimensional space. A powerful mix engine is proposed, supporting effects, a convolution engine for reverb, multiple sends, submixes, etc. Scheduled sound playback is provided for musical applications requiring a high degree of rhythmic precision.</p> 
<p>These APIs are currently under development, and we welcome feedback from other WebKit developers.</p> 
<h2>Getting Started</h2> 
<p>Currently, the Audio Canvas engine runs only on the Macintosh platform and requires a build from a special
<a href="https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/branches/audio/">branch</a> of WebKit.  This branch can be checked out using:

<pre>
svn co https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/branches/audio WebKit

<td style="width: 3000px;"><a href="doppler.html"><b>Doppler Shift</b></a> is a demo where an object is animated around the listener and illustrates both 3D spatialized positioning and doppler shifting, where the pitch of a sound increases as it moves toward the listener and decreases as it moves away.  It's possible to change the trajectory of the object left/right, front/back, and up/down, as well as to select some parameters such as speed, pitch, and sound source.<br>
