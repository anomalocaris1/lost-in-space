      <h2>Abstract</h2> 
     <p> 
      This specification describes a high-level JavaScript <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications.  The primary paradigm
      is of an audio routing graph, where a number of <a href="#AudioNode-section"><code>AudioNode</code></a> objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering.  The actual processing will primarily take place
      in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly / C / C++ code), but <a href="#JavaScriptProcessing-section">direct JavaScript processing and synthesis</a> is also supported.

     </p>
      
  
  <p>The <a href="#introduction">introductory</a> section covers the motivation behind this specification..</p> 
    <p> 
      This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform,
      notably: <a href="#XHR2" class="dfnref">XMLHttpRequest</a> (using the <code>responseType</code> and <code>response</code> attributes).
      For games and interactive applications, it is anticipated to be used with the <code>canvas</code> 2D and WebGL 3D graphics APIs.

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2> 
 
      <p class="norm">This section is informative.</p> 
 
    <p> 
      Audio on the web has been fairly primitive up to this point and until very recently has had to be delivered through plugins such as Flash and QuickTime.
      The introduction of the <code>audio</code> element in HTML5 is very important, allowing for basic streaming audio playback.
      But, it is not powerful enough to handle more complex audio applications. For sophisticated web-based games or interactive applications, another solution is required.
      It is a goal of this specification to include the capabilities found in modern game audio engines as well as some of the mixing, processing,
      and filtering tasks that are found in modern desktop audio production applications.
      
      <p>
      The APIs have been designed with a wide variety of <a href="#ExampleApplications-section">use cases</a> in mind.
      Ideally, it should be able to support <i>any</i> use case which could reasonably be implemented with an optimized C++ engine controlled via JavaScript and run in a browser.
      That said, modern desktop audio software can have very advanced capabilities, some of which would be difficult or impossible to build with this system.
      Apple's Logic Audio is one such application which has support for external MIDI controllers, arbitrary plugin audio effects and synthesizers,
      highly optimized direct-to-disk audio file reading/writing, tightly integrated time-stretching, and so on.
      Nevertheless, the proposed system will be quite capable of supporting a large range of reasonably complex games and interactive applications, including musical ones.
      And it can be a very good complement to the more advanced graphics features offered by WebGL.
      The API has been designed so that more advanced capabilities can be added at a later time.
      
      </p>
      
	    <div id="Features-section" class="section"> 
      <h2>1.1. Features</h2>

      <p>
        The API supports these primary features:

  <li> <a href="#EventScheduling-section">Sample-accurate scheduled sound playback</a> with low <a href="#Latency-section">latency</a> for musical applications requiring a very high degree of rhythmic precision such as drum machines and sequencers.  This also includes the possibility of <a href="#DynamicLifetime-section">dynamic creation</a> of effects. </li>

  <li> Automation of audio parameters for envelopes, fade-ins / fade-outs, granular effects, filter sweeps, LFOs etc. </li>

      <div id="ModularRouting-section">
      <h2>1.2. Modular Routing</h2>

        <p>
        Modular routing allows arbitrary connections between different <a href="#AudioNode-section"><code>AudioNode</code></a> objects.  Each node can have inputs and/or outputs.
        An <a href="#AudioSourceNode-section"><code>AudioSourceNode</code></a> has no inputs and a single output.  An <a href="#AudioDestinationNode-section"><code>AudioDestinationNode</code></a> has one input and no outputs and
        represents the final destination to the audio hardware.  Other nodes such as filters can be placed between
        the <a href="#AudioSourceNode-section"><code>AudioSourceNode</code></a> nodes and the final <a href="#AudioDestinationNode-section"><code>AudioDestinationNode</code></a> node.
        
        The developer doesn't have to worry about low-level stream format details when two objects are connected together; <a href="#UpMix-section">the right thing just happens</a>.
        For example, if a mono audio stream is connected to a stereo input it should just mix to left and right channels <a href="#UpMix-section">appropriately</a>.

        </p>
        <p>
        In the simplest case, a single source can be routed directly to the output.
          All routing occurs within an <a href="#AudioContext-section"><code>AudioContext</code></a> containing a single
        <a href="#AudioDestinationNode-section"><code>AudioDestinationNode</code></a>:
        </p>
        
        <img src="modular-routing1.png"/>

        <p>
            Illustrating this simple routing, here's a simple example playing a single sound:

                    <div class="block"><div class="blockTitleDiv"><span class="blockTitle">ECMAScript</span></div><div class="blockContent"><pre class="code"><code class="es-code"> 

            var context = new AudioContext();

            function playSound() {
                var source = context.createBufferSource();
                source.buffer = dogBarkingBuffer;
                source.connect(context.destination);
                source.noteOn(0);
            }
                    </code></pre></div></div> 


        </p>

        <p>
        Here's a more complex example with three sources and a convolution reverb send with a dynamics compressor at the final output stage:

      This interface represents an AudioNode for accessing the individual channels of an audio stream in the routing graph.
      It has a single input, and a number of "active" outputs which equals the number of channels in the input audio stream.  For example, if a stereo

      There are always a total number of 6 outputs,
      supporting up to 5.1 output (note: this upper limit of 6 is arbitrary and could be increased to support 7.2, and higher).  Any outputs which are not "active" will

      This interface represents an AudioNode for combining channels from multiple audio streams into a single audio stream.
      It has 6 inputs, but not all of them need be connected.  There is a single output whose audio stream has a number of channels
      equal to the sum of the numbers of channels of all the connected inputs.  For example, if an <code>AudioChannelMerger</code>
      has two connected inputs (both stereo), then the output will be four channels, the first two from the first input and the
      second two from the second input.  In another example with two connected inputs (both mono), the output will be two channels (stereo),
      with the left channel coming from the first input and the right channel coming from the second input.

    Be aware that it is possible to connect an <code>AudioChannelMerger</code> in such a way that it outputs an audio stream with a large number of channels greater
    than the maximum supported by the system (currently 6 channels for 5.1).  In this case, if the output is connected to anything else then an exception will
    be thrown indicating an error condition.  Thus, the <code>AudioChannelMerger</code> should be used in situations where the numbers of input channels is well
    understood.

  <p>
  It requires some thought to integrate cleanly with the existing media elements because they do not seem to have been designed with the idea of multiple
  types of audio sources, and its API is currently heavily oriented toward streaming.
  </p>



  <h3>Approach 1:</h3>


  One approach is to add a new attribute to the media elements <code>audio</code> and <code>video</code>, which for now can be called <code>audioSource</code>.
  It would be an <a href="#AudioNode-section"><code>AudioNode</code></a> of type <a href="#MediaElementAudioSourceNode"><code>MediaElementAudioSourceNode</code></a> which could be directly wired into an audio routing graph for processing streaming audio.

  The other types of AudioSourceNodes (such as AudioBufferSourceNode) can operate independently from any <code>audio</code> or <code>video</code> element:

</code></pre></div></div> 
</p>


  <h3>Approach 2:</h3>

Here an <a href="#MediaElementAudioSourceNode"><code>MediaElementAudioSourceNode</code></a> can be "adopted" from an HTMLMediaElement using an AudioContext method.  The advantage of this
approach is that is does not require any API changes to HTMLMediaElement.

  <div id="MixerGainStructure-section" class="section"> 
  <h2>6. Mixer Gain Structure</h2> 

  <h3> Background</h3>
  <p>
  One of the most important considerations when dealing with audio processing graphs is how to adjust the gain (volume) at various points.  For example, in a standard mixing board model,
  each input bus has pre-gain, post-gain, and send-gains.  Submix and master out busses also have gain control.  The gain control described here can be used to implement
  standard mixing boards as well as other architectures.
  </p>

  <div id="SummingJunction-section" class="section">
  <h3> Summing Inputs</h3>
  </div>
  
  <p>
  The inputs to <a href="#AudioNode-section"><code>AudioNodes</code></a> have the ability to accept connections from multiple outputs.
  The input then acts as a unity gain summing junction with each output signal being added with the others:
  </p>

  <img src="unity-gain-summing-junction.png"/>

<p>
  In cases where the channel layouts of the outputs do not match, an <a href="#UpMix-section">up-mix</a> will occur to the highest number of channels.
</p>

  <h3> Gain Control</h3>
  <p>
  But many times, it's important to be able to control the gain for each of the output signals.  The <a href="#AudioGainNode-section"><code>AudioGainNode</code></a> gives this control:
  </p>

  <img src="mixer-architecture-new.png"/>
  
  <p>
  Using these two concepts of unity gain summing junctions and AudioGainNodes, it's possible to construct simple or complex mixing scenarios.
  </p>
  
  <h3> Example: Mixer with Send Busses</h3>
  
  <p>
  In a routing scenario involving multiple sends and submixes, explicit control is needed over the volume or "gain" of each connection to a mixer.
  Such routing topologies are very common and exist in even the simplest of electronic gear sitting around in a basic recording studio.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here's an example with two send mixers and a main mixer.  Although possible, for simplicity's sake, pre-gain control and insert effects are not illustrated:
  </p>
  
  <img src="mixer-gain-structure.png"/>
  
  <p>
    This diagram is using a shorthand notation where "send 1", "send 2", and "main bus" are actually inputs to AudioNodes, but here are represented as summing busses,
    where the intersections g2_1, g3_1, etc. represent the "gain" or volume for the given source on the given mixer.
    In order to expose this gain, an <a href="#dfn-AudioGainNode"> <code>AudioGainNode</code></a> is used:

	    <h2>7. Dynamic Lifetime</h2>

			<h3>Background</h3>
	      <p>
	      In addition to allowing the creation of static routing configurations, it should also be possible to do custom effect routing on dynamically allocated voices which have
	      a limited lifetime.  For the purposes of this discussion, let's call these short-lived voices "notes".  Many audio applications incorporate the ideas of notes, examples being drum machines,
	      sequencers, and 3D games with many one-shot sounds being triggered according to game play.
	      </p>

	      <p>
	      In a traditional software synthesizer, notes are dynamically allocated and released from a pool of available resources.
	      The note is allocated when a MIDI note-on message is received.
	      It is released when the note has finished playing either due to it having reached the end of its sample-data (if non-looping),
	      it having reached a sustain phase of its envelope which is zero, or due to a MIDI note-off message putting it into the release phase of its envelope.
	      In the MIDI note-off case, the note is not released immediately, but only when the release envelope phase has finished. At any given time,
	      there can be a large number of notes playing but the set of notes is constantly changing as new notes are added into the routing graph, and old ones are released.
	      </p>

	      <p>
	      The audio system automatically deals with tearing-down the part of the routing graph for individual "note" events.
	      A "note" is represented by an <code>AudioBufferSourceNode</code>, which can be directly connected to other processing nodes.  When the note has finished playing, the context will automatically
	      release the reference to the <code>AudioBufferSourceNode</code>, which in turn will release references to any nodes it is connected to, and so on.  The nodes will automatically get disconnected
	      from the graph and will be deleted when they have no more references.  Nodes in the graph which are long-lived and shared between dynamic voices can be managed explicitly.
	      Although it sounds complicated, this all happens automatically with no extra JavaScript handling required.
	      </p>

				<h3>Example</h3>

	        <div class="example"><div class="exampleHeader">Example</div> 
	        <img src="dynamic-allocation.png"/>

	        <p>The low-pass filter, panner, and second gain nodes are directly connected from the one-shot sound.  So when it has finished playing the context will
	         automatically release them (everything within the dotted line).  If there are no longer any JavaScript references to the one-shot sound and connected nodes, then they will be immediately 
	         removed from the graph and deleted. The streaming source, has a global reference and will remain connected until it is explicitly disconnected.

	        Here's how it might look in JavaScript:

    </div>







<div id="Spatialization-section" class="section"> 
<h2>11. Spatialization / Panning </h2>

<h3> Background</h3>

<p>
A common feature requirement for modern 3D games is the ability to dynamically spatialize and move multiple audio sources in 3D space.
Game audio engines such as OpenAL, FMOD, Creative's EAX, Microsoft's XACT Audio, etc. have this ability.
</p>

<p>
Using an <code>AudioPannerNode</code>, an audio stream can be spatialized or positioned in space relative to an <code>AudioListener</code>.  An <a href="#AudioContext-section"><code>AudioContext</code></a> will
contain a single <code>AudioListener</code>.   Both panners and listeners have a position in 3D space using a cartesian coordinate system.
<code>AudioPannerNode</code> objects (representing the source stream) have an <code>orientation</code> vector representing in which direction the sound is projecting.
Additionally, they have a <code>sound cone</code> representing how directional the sound is.  For example, the sound could be omnidirectional, in which case it would be heard
anywhere regardless of its orientation, or it can be more directional and heard only if it is facing the listener.
<code>AudioListener</code> objects (representing a person's ears) have an <code>orientation</code> and <code>up</code> vector representing in which direction the person is facing.
Because both the source stream and the listener can be moving, they both have a <code>velocity</code> vector representing both the speed and direction of movement.  Taken together,
these two velocities can be used to generate a doppler shift effect which changes the pitch.
</p>

<h3>Panning Algorithm</h3>

<p>
The following algorithms can be implemented:
</p>

<ul>
  
  <li> Equal-power (Vector-based) panning
    <p>
      This is a simple and relatively inexpensive algorithm which provides basic, but reasonable results.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <li> Sound-field (<a href="http://www.ambisonic.net/">Ambisonics</a>)
      <p>
        Attempts to recreate the acoustic field.
      </p>

  <br>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function">HRTF</a> panning (stereo only)
  <p>
    This requires a set of HRTF impulse responses recorded at a variety of azimuths and elevations.  There are a small number of open/free impulse responses available.
    The implementation requires a highly optimized convolution function.  It is somewhat more costly than "equal-power", but provides a more spatialized sound.
  </p>
  <img src="HRTF_panner.png">

  <li> Pass-through
    <p>
      This is mostly useful for stereo sources to pass the left/right channels unpanned to the left/right speakers.  Similarly for 5.0 sources,
      the channels can be passed unchanged.
    </p>

</ul>


<h3> Distance Effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sources farther away are typically quieter than nearer ones.
<li>Different rolloff curves are assignable per-source: linear, inverse, exponential
</ul

<h3> Sound Cones</h3>

<p>
The listener and each sound source have an orientation vector describing which way they are facing.
Each sound source's sound projection characteristics are described by an inner and outer "cone" describing the
sound intensity as a function of the source/listener angle from the source's orientation vector.   Thus, a sound source
pointing directly at the listener will be louder than if it is pointed off-axis. Sound sources can also be omni-directional.
</p>



<p>
<h3> Doppler Shift</h3>
  <ul>
	<li> Introduces a pitch shift which can realistically simulate moving
		sources
	<li> Depends on: source / listener velocity vectors, speed of sound, doppler factor
  </ul>


</div>







<div id="Convolution-section" class="section"> 
<h2>12. Linear Effects using Convolution</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">Convolution</a> is a mathematical process which can be applied to an audio signal to achieve many interesting high-quality linear effects.
Very often, the effect is used to simulate an acoustic space such as a concert hall, cathedral, or outdoor amphitheater.  It can also
be used for complex filter effects, like a muffled sound coming from inside a closet, sound underwater, sound coming through a telephone,
or playing through a vintage speaker cabinet.  This technique is very commonly used in major motion picture and music production and is
considered to be extremely versatile and of high quality.
</p>

<p>
Each unique effect is defined by an <code>impulse response</code>.  An impulse response can be represented as an audio file and <a href="#recording-impulse-responses">can be recorded</a> from 
a real acoustic space such as a cave, or can be synthetically generated through a great variety of techniques.
</p>

<h3>Motivation for use as a Standard</h3>
<p>
A key feature of many game audio engines (OpenAL, FMOD, Creative's EAX, Microsoft's XACT Audio, etc.) is a reverberation effect for simulating the sound of being in an acoustic space.
But the code used to generate the effect has generally been custom and algorithmic (generally using
a hand-tweaked set of delay lines and allpass filters which feedback into each other).  In nearly all cases, not only is the implementation custom, but
the code is proprietary and closed-source, each company adding its own "black magic" to achieve its unique quality.
Each implementation being custom with a different set of parameters makes it impossible to achieve a uniform desired effect.  And the code
being proprietary makes it impossible to adopt a single one of the implementations as a standard.  Additionally, algorithmic reverberation effects
are limited to a relatively narrow range of different effects, regardless of how the parameters are tweaked.
</p>

<p>
A convolution effect solves these problems by using a very precisely defined mathematical algorithm as the basis of its processing.
An impulse response represents an exact sound effect to be applied to an audio stream and
is easily represented by an audio file which can be referenced by URL.  The range of possible effects is enormous.
</p>



<h3>Reverb Effect (with matrixing)</h3>

<p>
Single channel convolution operates on a mono audio source, using a mono impulse response.  But to achieve a more spacious sound,
multi-channel audio sources and impulse responses must be considered.  Audio sources and playback systems can be stereo, 5.1, or more
channels.  In the general case the source has N input channels, the impulse response has K channels, and the playback system has M output channels.
Thus it's a matter of how to matrix these channels to achieve the final result.  The following diagram, illustrates the common cases for stereo
playback where N, K, and M are all less than or equal to 2.  Similarly, the matrixing for 5.1 and other playback configurations can be defined.
</p>

<h3>Recording Impulse Responses</h3>
</a>

<p class="norm">This section is informative.</p> 

<img src="impulse-response.png">
<br><br>

The most <a href="http://pcfarina.eng.unipr.it/Public/Papers/226-AES122.pdf">modern</a>
 and accurate way to record the impulse response of a real acoustic space is to use
a long exponential sine sweep.  The test-tone can be as long as 20 or 30 seconds, or longer.




  Several recordings of the
test tone played through a speaker can be made with microphones placed and oriented at various positions in the room.  It's important
to document speaker placement/orientation, the types of microphones, their settings, placement, and orientations for each recording taken.

<p>
Post-processing is required for each of these recordings by performing an inverse-convolution with the test tone,
yielding the impulse response of the room with the corresponding microphone placement.  These impulse responses are then
ready to be loaded into the convolution reverb engine to re-create the sound of being in the room.
</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>
Two command-line tools have been written:
</p>
 <code>generate_testtones</code> generates an exponential sine-sweep test-tone and its inverse.  Another
tool <code>convolve</code> was written for post-processing.  With these tools, anybody with recording equipment can record their own impulse responses.
  To test the tools in practice, several recordings were made in a warehouse space with interesting
acoustics.  These were later post-processed with the command-line tools.
</p>

Usage: generate_testtone
	[-o /Path/To/File/To/Create] Two files will be created: .tone and .inverse

<h2>13. JavaScript Synthesis and Processing</h2>

<p class="norm">This section is informative.</p> 

<p>
The Mozilla project has conducted <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Audio_Data_API">Experiments</a> to synthesize and process audio directly in JavaScript.
This approach is interesting for a certain class of audio processing and they have produced a number of impressive demos.  This specification includes
a means of synthesizing and processing directly using JavaScript by using a special subtype of <a href="#AudioNode-section"><code>AudioNode</code></a>
called <a href="#JavaScriptAudioNode-section"><code>JavaScriptAudioNode</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are some interesting examples where direct JavaScript processing can be useful:
</p>

<h3>Custom DSP Effects</h3>
<p>
Unusual and interesting custom audio processing can be done directly in JS.
It's also a good test-bed for prototyping new algorithms. This is an extremely rich area.
</p>

<h3>Educational Applications</h3>
<p>
JS processing is ideal for illustrating concepts in computer music synthesis and processing,
 such as showing the de-composition of a square wave into its harmonic components, FM synthesis techniques, etc.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript Performance</h3>
<p>
JavaScript has a variety of <a href="#JavaScriptPerformance-section">performance issues</a> so it is not suitable for all types of audio processing.
The approach proposed in this document includes the ability to perform computationally intensive aspects of the audio processing (too expensive for JavaScript to compute in real-time) 
such as multi-source 3D spatialization and convolution in optimized C++ code.  Both direct JavaScript processing and C++ optimized code can be combined due to the APIs

<h3>15.1. Latency: What it is and Why it's Important</h3>
</div>

<img src="latency.png">

<p>
For web applications, the time delay between mouse and keyboard events (keydown, mousedown, etc.) and a sound being heard is important.
</p>

<p>
  This time delay is called latency and is caused by several factors (input device latency, internal buffering latency, DSP processing latency, output device latency, distance of user's ears from speakers, etc.), and is cummulative.  The larger this latency is, the less satisfying the user's experience is going
  to be.  In the extreme, it can make musical production or game-play impossible.  At moderate levels it can affect timing and give the impression of
  sounds lagging behind or the game being non-responsive.  For musical applications the timing problems affect rhythm.  For gaming, the timing problems affect precision of  gameplay.
  For interactive applications, it generally cheapens the users experience much in the same way that very low animation frame-rates do.
  Depending on the application, a reasonable latency can be from as low as 3-6 milliseconds to 25-50 milliseconds.
</p>


<div id="Glitching-section" class="section">
<h3>15.2. Audio Glitching</h3>
</div>
<p>
  Audio glitches are caused by an interruption of the normal continuous audio stream, resulting in loud clicks and pops.  It is considered to be
  a catastrophic failure of a multi-media system and must be avoided.  It can be caused by problems with the threads responsible for delivering the audio
  stream to the hardware, such as scheduling latencies caused by threads not having the proper priority and time-constraints.  It can also be caused by
  the audio DSP trying to do more work than is possible in real-time given the CPU's speed.
</p>


<h3>15.3. Hardware Scalability</h3>
<p>
The system should gracefully degrade to allow audio processing under resource constrained conditions without dropping audio frames.
</p>

<p>
First of all, it should be clear that regardless of the platform, the audio processing load should never be enough to completely lock up the 
machine.  Second, the audio rendering needs to produce a clean, un-interrupted audio stream without audible
<a href="#Glitching-section">glitches</a>.
</p>	

<p>
The system should be able to run on a range of hardware, from mobile phones and tablet devices to laptop and desktop computers.
But the more limited compute resources on a phone device make it necessary to consider techniques to scale back and reduce the complexity
of the audio rendering.  For example, voice-dropping algorithms can be implemented to reduce the total number of notes playing at any given time.
</p>
	



<p>
Here's a list of some techniques which can be used to limit CPU usage:
</p>

<h4>15.3.1. CPU monitoring</h4>
<p>
In order to avoid audio breakup, CPU usage must remain below 100%.
</p>
<p>
The relative CPU usage can be dynamically measured for each AudioNode (and chains of connected nodes) as a percentage of the rendering time
quantum.  In a single-threaded implementation, overall CPU usage must remain below 100%.  The measured usage may be used internally in the implementation
for dynamic adjustments to the rendering.  It may also be exposed through a <code>cpuUsage</code> attribute of <code>AudioNode</code>
for use by JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
In cases where the measured CPU usage is near 100% (or whatever threshold is considered too high), then an attempt to add additional
<code>AudioNodes</code> into the rendering graph can trigger voice-dropping.
</p>

<h4>15.3.2. Voice Dropping</h4>
<p>
	Voice-dropping is a technique which limits the number of voices (notes) playing at the same time to keep CPU usage within a reasonable range.
	There can either be an upper threshold on the total number of voices allowed at any given time, or CPU usage can be dynamically monitored
	and voices dropped when CPU usage exceeds a threshold.  Or a combination of these two techniques can be applied.  When CPU usage is monitored
	for each voice, it can be measured all the way from the AudioSourceNode through any effect processing nodes which apply uniquely to that voice.
</p>

<p>	
  When a voice is "dropped", it
	needs to happen in such a way that it doesn't introduce audible clicks or pops into the rendered audio stream.  One way to achieve this is to
	quickly fade-out the rendered audio for that voice before completely removing it from the rendering graph.
</p>	

<p>	
	When it is determined that one or more voices must be dropped, there are various strategies for picking which voice(s) to drop out of the
	total ensemble of voices currently playing.  Here are some of the factors which can be used in combination to help with this decision:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> Older voices, which have been playing the longest can be dropped instead of more recent voices. </li>
	<li> Quieter voices, which are contributing less to the overall mix may be dropped instead of louder ones. </li>
	<li> Voices which are consuming relatively more CPU resources may be dropped instead of less "expensive" voices.
	<li> An AudioNode can have a <code>priority</code> attribute to help determine the relative importance of the voices.</li>
</ul>

<h4>15.3.3. Simplification of Effects Processing</h4>

<p>
Most of the effects described in this document are relatively inexpensive and will likely be able to run even on the slower mobile devices.
However, the <a href="#ConvolverNode-section">convolution effect</a> can be configured with a variety of impulse responses, some of which
will likely be too heavy for mobile devices.  Generally speaking, CPU usage scales with the length of the impulse response and the number of channels it has.  Thus, it is reasonable to consider that impulse responses which exceed a certain length will not be allowed to run.
The exact limit can be determined based on the speed of the device.  Instead of outright rejecting convolution with these long responses,
it may be interesting to consider truncating the impulse responses to the maximum allowed length and/or reducing the number of channels
of the impulse response.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the convolution effect.  The <a href="#AudioPannerNode-section"><code>AudioPannerNode</code></a> may also be expensive
if using the HRTF panning model.  For slower devices, a cheaper algorithm such as EQUALPOWER can be used to conserve compute resources.
</p>

<h4>15.3.4. Sample Rate</h4>
<p>
For very slow devices, it may be worth considering running the rendering at a lower sample-rate than normal.  For example, the sample-rate 
can be reduced from 44.1KHz to 22.05KHz.  This decision must be made when the <code>AudioContext</code> is created, because changing the sample-rate on-the-fly can be difficult
to implement and will result in audible glitching when the transition is made.
</p>



<h4>15.3.5. Pre-flighting</h4>
<p>
It should be possible to invoke some kind of "pre-flighting" code (through JavaScript) to roughly determine the power of the machine.
The JavaScript code can then use this information to scale back any more intensive processing it may normally run on a more powerful machine.
Also, the underlying implementation may be able to factor in this information in the voice-dropping algorithm.
</p>

<p>
	TODO: add specification and more detail here
</p>

<h4>15.3.6. Authoring for different user agents</h4>
JavaScript code can use information about user-agent to scale back any more intensive processing it may normally run on a more powerful machine.

<h4>15.3.7. Scalability of Direct JavaScript Synthesis / Processing</h4>
<p>
Any audio DSP / processing code done directly in JavaScript should also be concerned about scalability.  To the extent possible, the JavaScript
code itself needs to monitor CPU usage and scale back any more ambitious processing when run on less powerful devices.  If it's an "all or nothing" type of processing, then user-agent check or pre-flighting should be done to avoid generating an audio stream with audio breakup.

<h3>15.4. JavaScript Issues with real-time Processing and Synthesis: </h3>
</div>

While processing audio in JavaScript, it is extremely challenging to get reliable, glitch-free audio while achieving a reasonably low-latency,
especially under heavy processor load.

<ul>
    <li> JavaScript is very much slower than heavily optimized C++ code and is not able to take advantage of SSE optimizations and multi-threading which is
        critical for getting good performance on today's processors.  Optimized native code can be on the order of twenty times faster for processing FFTs as
        compared with JavaScript.  It is not efficient enough for heavy-duty processing of audio such as convolution and 3D spatialization of large numbers of audio sources. </li>
    <li> setInterval() and XHR handling will steal time from the audio processing.  In a reasonably complex game, some JavaScript resources will be
      needed for game physics and graphics. This creates challenges because audio rendering is deadline driven (to avoid glitches and get low enough latency).</li>
    <li> JavaScript does not run in a real-time processing thread and thus can be pre-empted by many other threads running on the system.</li>
    <li> Garbage Collection (and autorelease pools on Mac OS X) can cause unpredictable delay on a JavaScript thread. </li>
    <li> Multiple JavaScript contexts can be running on the main thread, stealing time from the context doing the processing. </li>
    <li> Other code (other than JavaScript) such as page rendering runs on the main thread. </li>
    <li> Locks can be taken and memory is allocated on the JavaScript thread.  This can cause additional thread preemption. </li>
</ul>

The problems are even more difficult with today's generation of mobile devices which have processors with relatively poor performance and power consumption / battery-life issues.

<h2>16. Example Applications</h2> 

<p class="norm">This section is informative.</p> 

<p>
Please see the <a href="http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/index.html">demo</a> page for working examples.	
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the types of applications a web audio system should be able to support:
</p>

<h3>Basic Sound Playback</h3>
<p>
	Simple and <a href="#Latency-section"><strong>low-latency</strong></a> playback of sound effects in response to simple user actions such as mouse click, roll-over, key press.
</p>

<br>

<h3>3D Environments and Games</h3>

<img src="beach-demo.png">

<br><br>

<p>
An <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/01/google-html5-quake/">HTML5 version of Quake</a> has already been created.  Audio features such as 3D spatialization and convolution for room simulation could be used to great effect.
</p>

<p>
3D environments with audio are common in games made for desktop applications and game consoles.
Imagine a 3D island environment with spatialized audio, seagulls flying overhead, the waves crashing against the shore, the
crackling of the fire, the creaking of the bridge, and the rustling of the trees in the wind.  The sounds can be positioned
naturally as one moves through the scene.  Even going underwater, low-pass filters can be tweaked for just the right underwater sound.
</p>

<br><br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.box2d.org/">Box2D</a> is an interesting open-source library for 2D game physics.  It has various implementations, including one
based on Canvas 2D.  A demo has been created with dynamic sound effects for each of the object collisions, taking into account the velocities vectors and
positions to spatialize the sound events, and modulate audio effect parameters such as filter cutoff.
</p>

<p>
A virtual pool game with multi-sampled sound effects has also been created.

<h3>Musical Applications</h3>

<br><br>
Many music composition and production applications are possible.  Applications requiring tight scheduling of audio events can be implemented and can be both educational and entertaining.  Drum machines, digital DJ applications, and even timeline-based digital music production software with some of the features of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GarageBand">GarageBand</a> can be written.
<br>

<br>

<h3>Music Visualizers</h3>

<br><br>
When combined with WebGL GLSL shaders, realtime analysis data can be presented in entertaining ways.  These can be as advanced as any found in iTunes.
<br><br>

<h3>Educational Applications</h3>
